##Description
A template for executing shell code by date.

##Instruction
1. Substitute the code part `Your code here` with your code.
2. Use variable `executeDate` as current execute date.
3. `sh executeByDate startDate finalDate (stepDay)` for your code. If `startDate` is greater than `finalDate`, the program will execute inversely in date. `stepDay` means the days step to execute. The default value of `stepDay` is 1 if you do not input for that argument. 

##Output
One example output is like this:

> \**********************
> 
> Execute date: 20170608
> 
> \**********************
> 
> ##########Your output##########
> 
> \****************************************
> 
> Date 20170608 has already been executed.
> 
> \****************************************
>
